# Specification Quality Checklist: Voucher Auto-Purge and Admin Purge

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-07-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Assumptions are well-documented for decisions made without explicit user input (e.g., lazy vs scheduled purge, grant nullification vs cascade delete, migration backfill strategy).
- FR-001 through FR-014 cover all functional aspects: auto-purge, manual purge, timestamp tracking, data integrity, audit logging, and error handling.
- SC-001 through SC-006 are all measurable and technology-agnostic.
