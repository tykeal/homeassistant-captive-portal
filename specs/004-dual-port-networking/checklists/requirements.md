# Specification Quality Checklist: Dual-Port Networking

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-07-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Technical constraints are documented at a high level (no solution-specific design)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for technical and product stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed — the feature description was detailed enough to make informed decisions for all requirements.
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults chosen where the description did not specify (default port 8099, rate limiting defaults, static URL configuration).
