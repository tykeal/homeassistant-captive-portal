# Constitution Gate Checklist

Tracking file referenced per phase to ensure adherence to engineering constitution (T0009).

## Gates
| Gate | Description | Evidence (File/Task) | Phase Verified |
|------|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
| SPDX Headers | All source/spec files carry SPDX header | automated pre-commit, spot check | 0 |
| TDD Order | Tests added before implementation each phase | tasks.md ordering (tests first sections) | 0 |
| Performance Baselines | Numeric baselines defined early | plan.md Performance Baselines, performance_baselines.md | 1 (planned) |
| Security Headers | HTTP security headers & CSRF enforced | tests/integration/test_session_cookie_security_headers.py (T0712) | 4 (planned) |
| Audit Logging Completeness | All actions logged with required fields | tests/integration/test_audit_log_completeness.py (T0602) | 6 (planned) |
| Metrics Coverage | Key metrics exported (latency, sessions, failures) | metrics instrumentation tasks (T0313, T0717) | 3/6 (planned) |
| Gate Checklist Maintained | This file updated per phase review | T0009/T0120/T0214/... review tasks | each phase |

## Update Procedure
1. At end of each phase run review task (e.g., T0120) and fill Phase Verified column for gates satisfied.
2. Add new gates if constitution evolves; do not remove historical entries.
3. Block next phase start if any mandatory gate for prior phase incomplete.

## Phase 0 Verification
- SPDX headers: pass
- TDD scaffolds present: pass
- Baselines defined: integrated (plan.md updated)
- Checklist file created: yes
