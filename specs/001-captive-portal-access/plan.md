# Implementation Plan: Captive Portal Guest Access

**Branch**: `001-captive-portal-access` | **Date**: 2025-10-22 | **Spec**: ./spec.md | **Phase1**: ./phase1.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-captive-portal-access/spec.md`

## Summary

Implement a pluggable captive portal enabling rental guest network access with voucher validation, administrative grant management, Home Assistant entity mapping, and TP-Omada controller integration. Deliver as a Home Assistant addon but runnable standalone (container) with consistent configuration.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI (HTTP/API & admin UI simple templating), Jinja2 (theming templates), httpx (async HTTP to TP-Omada + HA REST), SQLModel (initial SQLite persistence), passlib/bcrypt (password hashing), pydantic (data validation), uv (package/environment manager), alembic (for future DB migrations if upgraded beyond SQLite)
**Storage**: Adopt SQLite via SQLModel behind a repository abstraction (Clarification Q1). Future upgrade path to PostgreSQL documented; no multi-instance requirement in v1.
**Testing**: pytest + pytest-asyncio; coverage enforcement; contract tests for controller API boundaries using recorded fixtures; integration tests spinning up FastAPI test client.
**Target Platform**: Home Assistant addon container (based on addons-example best practices) & generic OCI container (Docker/Podman)
**Project Type**: Single backend project (web portal + API) with minimal frontend templating (no SPA framework initially)
**Performance Baselines (p95 unless noted)**:
- Voucher redemption: ≤800ms (L1: 50 concurrent) / ≤900ms (L2: 200 concurrent)
- Auth login API: ≤300ms; Controller propagation (authorize→active): ≤25s; Admin grants list (500 grants): ≤1500ms
- Memory RSS: ≤150MB; CPU 1-min peak: ≤60% @ 200 concurrent; Merge gate: >10% regression vs baseline blocks
- Non-blocking IO (async); bandwidth shaping delegated to controller
**Scale/Scope**: Single property initial; design for extension to multiple controllers and properties (multi-tenancy deferred). Concurrent guests <50 typical; admin users <5.

## Constitution Check

Refer to `constitution_gate_checklist.md` for per-phase gate verification (introduced Phase 0, task T0009).

Gates derived from constitution:
- Atomic commits: Plan phases enforce granular task breakdown.
- SPDX headers: Template enforcement; automation script will insert headers for new files.
- TDD: Tests defined per phase before implementation tasks start (see Phases below).
- Performance baselines: SC-001..SC-003 mapped to test scaffolds; TODO(PERFORMANCE_BASELINES) remains for precise p95 thresholds.
- Pre-commit integrity: Add pre-commit config (ruff/black/pytest/REUSE, etc.) in Phase 0.
Status: All gates feasible; outstanding TODO: finalize storage engine decision & baseline numeric performance thresholds.

**Structure Decision**: Single backend project with modular directories; avoids premature multi-project complexity while enabling future controller additions via `controllers/` pluggable pattern.

## Phase Breakdown & TDD Sequencing

### Phase 0: Research & Environment Setup
Deliverables: research.md, initial pre-commit config, dependency selection, controller API analysis summary (mapping of needed endpoints), HA REST entity discovery notes.
Tests (author first): None functional yet; add placeholder performance baseline test scaffolds (skipped) and config loading unit tests.
Constitution Gate Re-check: Verify SPDX headers on new files, pre-commit active, TDD scaffolds present.

### Phase 1: Data Model & Contracts
Deliverables: data-model.md (Voucher, AccessGrant, AdminAccount, EntityMapping, AuditLog models), contracts/ (OpenAPI draft for internal API, JSON schema for voucher redemption request/response, controller interaction contract stubs).
Tests first: unit tests for model validation (pydantic), contract tests using mocked controller responses; negative tests for duplicate voucher race condition simulation.
Constitution Gate Re-check: Confirm all new files have SPDX headers, tests exist before implementation, atomic commit sequencing followed.

### Phase 2: Core Services (Voucher & Grant Logic)
Implement voucher creation, redemption flow, grant lifecycle (create/update/revoke), duplicate prevention semaphore/locking strategy.
Tests first: service-level unit tests (voucher expiration, grant extension), concurrency test for duplicate redemption.
Constitution Gate Re-check: Ensure tests failing before code, validate no pre-commit bypass, verify audit/logging tasks planned.

### Phase 3: Controller Integration (HA + TP-Omada)
Implement HA integration (REST client, 60s polling, Rental Control event processing) + TP-Omada adapter (external portal API, retry queue). Includes models for HAIntegrationConfig (auth attribute selection, grace period), RentalControlEvent (caching), CleanupService (7-day retention), and BookingCodeValidator (case-insensitive matching).
Tests first: HA client tests (mocked REST), poller tests (60s + backoff), event processing tests (attribute selection/fallback), TP-Omada contract tests (fixture responses), cleanup tests (retention policy), case-insensitive booking code matching tests.
Backend-only (Decision D11): REST API endpoints for integration management and booking authorization; UI deferred to Phase 4.
Constitution Gate Re-check: Confirm adapter tests cover error paths (retry), HA unavailability tests (backoff), metrics instrumentation test present before implementation, migration tests for schema changes.

### Phase 4: Admin Web Interface & Theming
Constitution Gate Re-check: Validate security headers, CSRF tests precede implementation, theme precedence test (remediation) added before UI changes.
Implement authentication (secure HTTP-only server-side session cookies + CSRF protection using argon2 password hashing per D13), admin CRUD for vouchers/grants, entity mapping UI, theming loader.
Session Management (D12): Server-side session cookies (HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=Strict) with configurable lifetimes (default 30 min idle, 8 hr absolute per D17).
CSRF Protection (D14): Double-submit cookie pattern (stateless, 32-byte random token).
Admin UI Theme (D15): Minimal CSS (no framework) for smaller bundle, modern CSS features (grid, flexbox, CSS variables).
Guest Portal Theming (D16): CSS variable overrides (admin-configurable colors, logo) stored in GuestPortalTheme model; deferred UI to Phase 5.
Includes deferred Phase 3 UI (Decision D11): HA integration configuration forms, guest booking code authorization form, enhanced grants display.
Tests first: integration tests for admin routes (auth success/failure), CSRF enforcement tests, session timeout tests (idle + absolute), template rendering checks (no sensitive data leakage), UI tests for booking code forms and integration management.
Decisions reference: See phase4_decisions.md for full rationale on D12-D17 (all approved 2025-10-27T00:45:00Z).

### Phase 5: Guest Portal & Authentication
Constitution Gate Re-check: Confirm booking code validation tests cover all FR-018 error scenarios (invalid_format, not_found, outside_window, duplicate, integration_unavailable), metrics tests present, audit logging tests present, rate limiting tests present, redirect validation tests present.
Guest-facing captive portal with unified authorization form (voucher + booking code), rate limiting, post-authentication redirect handling, and checkout grace period support.
Authorization Form Access (D18): Both direct URL (`/guest/authorize`) and captive portal detection redirects (covers all guest arrival paths).
Unified Input Field (D19): Single code input field, backend auto-detects voucher vs booking code; booking codes case-insensitive match, case-sensitive storage.
Rate Limiting (D20): Admin-configurable per-IP rate limiting (default 5 attempts/minute) to prevent brute-force attacks.
Post-Auth Redirect (D21): Admin-configurable redirect behavior, default to original destination URL with fallback to success page.
Grace Period (D22): Admin-configurable checkout grace period (default 15 min, max 30 min) extends booking access post-checkout.
Tests first: unified authorization form tests (voucher/booking detection), rate limiting enforcement tests, redirect validation tests (whitelist, open redirect prevention), grace period calculation tests, captive portal detection redirect tests, end-to-end guest flow tests.
Decisions reference: See phase5_decisions.md for full rationale on D18-D22 (all approved 2025-10-29T18:42:00Z).

### Phase 6: Performance & Hardening
Constitution Gate Re-check: Finalize performance baselines before removing test skips; enforce audit/log completeness tests present.
Add benchmark tests for voucher redemption path, log audit completeness tests, finalize performance baseline numbers.
Refactor for any identified bottlenecks.

### Phase 7: Polish & Documentation
Constitution Gate Re-check: Ensure documentation reflects final baselines, all SPDX headers verified, no skipped tests remain.

**Documentation Scope (D23)**: Comprehensive documentation including quickstart, architecture overview, HA integration guide, TP-Omada setup guide, troubleshooting guide, and admin UI walkthrough. Critical for adoption and support given complex multi-system integration.

**Security Hardening (D24)**: Basic security response headers (X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff) for defense in depth without over-engineering. Full CSP deferred as it may break theming or future extensions.

**Audit Log Retention (D25)**: Configurable retention policy separate from grants/vouchers (default 30 days, max 90 days) to support compliance requirements and incident response windows.

**API Documentation (D26)**: Embedded OpenAPI docs at `/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/redoc` endpoints (admin-only RBAC) to enable custom integrations and automation.

**Metrics Export (D27)**: No metrics export for MVP - defer to Phase 8 if operational need emerges. Audit logs + performance tests provide sufficient visibility.

**SPDX Compliance (D28)**: Automated `reuse lint` verification with spot-check of high-visibility files (LICENSE, README, addon config).

**Tech Debt Items**: Cleanup TODO comments from Phase 6 (admin auth placeholders, proxy trust configuration).

Tests: Security headers verification, API docs access control, audit retention configuration, SPDX compliance validation.

Decisions reference: See phase6_review.md for full rationale on D23-D28 (approved 2025-10-30T20:00:00Z).

## Role-Based Access Control (FR-017)

FR-017: System SHALL enforce role-based permissions: {Viewer: read dashboards only; Operator: viewer + trigger captive session resets; Admin: operator + manage vouchers/roles; Auditor: viewer + access immutable logs}. No other actions permitted (deny-by-default). Permission matrix documented and tests (authorization allow/deny, negative) precede implementation.

## Booking Identifier Validation (FR-018)

FR-018: System SHALL validate guest authorization (booking) codes against Rental Control events.
- Source Entities per integration: calendar.rental_control_<integration_id>, sensor.rental_control_<integration_id>_event_[0..N-1].
- Polling: Phase 3 poller fetches all configured integrations every 60s; exponential backoff on HA unavailability (Decision D6).
- Event Cache: RentalControlEvent model stores events for 7 days post-checkout (Decision D8); daily 3 AM cleanup.
- Prioritized Events: event 0 (current or checking-out today), event 1 (upcoming/arriving today). All events 0..N-1 are eligible if within [start, end + grace_period].
- Candidate Identifier Attributes: slot_code (default), slot_name, or last_four (admin-selectable per integration via HAIntegrationConfig.auth_attribute, Decision D7). Admin chooses once per integration; selection persisted. Fallback logic: configured → slot_code → slot_name → skip event.
- Grace Period: Checkout grace period extends end_utc by 0-30 minutes (default 15, configurable via HAIntegrationConfig.checkout_grace_minutes, Decision D9).
- Formats: slot_code regex ^\d{4,}$; last_four regex ^\d{4}$; slot_name treated as opaque string (non-empty, trimmed, <=128 chars).
- Guest Input: Single authorization code field (no username).
- Case Sensitivity: Matching case-INSENSITIVE for guest input (D10); storage and display case-SENSITIVE (preserve original from Rental Control for admin cross-reference).
- Validation Window: Access allowed from event.start (floored to minute) until event.end + grace_period (ceiled to minute). Access grants lifetime resolved to minute boundaries.
- Devices: Unlimited devices per valid booking within window.
- Failure Responses: 400 invalid format; 404 booking not found; 410 booking outside active window; 409 duplicate active grant (same code already redeemed and still valid) returns existing grant reference.
- Metrics: booking_lookup_latency (histogram), validation_fail_total (counter with reason labels: invalid_format, not_found, outside_window, duplicate, integration_unavailable), ha_polling_errors (counter).
- Audit Log: booking_code_attempt (code_hash, integration_id, outcome, reason, correlation_id), event.cleanup (deleted_count), ha_polling_failure (integration_id, backoff_seconds).
- Future: Bandwidth limits & guest upgrade path (deferred; note for roadmap).
- Security: Deny-by-default if integration selection missing or events unavailable (reason: integration_unavailable).

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| Async architecture | Needed for non-blocking controller/HA calls | Sync IO would raise latency & block scaling |
| Pluggable controllers dir | Future multi-controller support | Single file adapter would become monolith |

## Initial Task Seeds (High-Level)
(Details deferred to /speckit.tasks)
- Setup uv project, pyproject.toml, add dependencies
- Add addon skeleton (Dockerfile, config.json, run script) based on home-assistant/addons-example
- Add pre-commit config (ruff, reuse, pytest, black if used)
- research.md: summarize TP-Omada endpoints (login, authorize, revoke) & HA entity endpoints
- data-model.md: define entities & relationships
- contracts/: define OpenAPI routers & controller interface spec
- Implement persistence abstraction + SQLite default (repository pattern)
- Voucher service + tests (create, validate, prevent duplicates)
- Grant service + tests (create, extend, revoke, audit logging)
- Controller adapter (tp_omada) + contract tests
- Admin auth (password hashing, secure HTTP-only session cookies + CSRF) + tests
- Web templates (portal page, admin dashboard) basic theme config
- HA mapping integration logic + tests
- Performance scaffolds (benchmark voucher redemption)

## Open Questions (Resolved Clarifications Applied)
1. Storage choice: RESOLVED → SQLite via SQLModel behind abstraction (Q1)
2. Admin auth mechanism: RESOLVED → Secure HTTP-only server-side session cookies + CSRF protection (Q2)

## Risk & Mitigation
- Controller API instability: Implement resilient retry with capped exponential backoff.
- Race conditions on voucher redemption: Use DB uniqueness + async lock.
- HA API latency/unavailability: Cache entity mapping, degrade gracefully.
- Performance regression risk: Add benchmark early Phase 6 before polish.

## Next Steps
Proceed to Phase 0 tasks ensuring test placeholders created before service logic. After Phase 1 completion run constitution re-check (coverage, TDD adherence, performance baseline TODOs tracked).
